Technologies Used
Flutter: For building the responsive web app.
Dart: Programming language for Flutter.
Hugging Face Inference API: Intended for conversational responses (mocked in this demo).
GitHub Pages: Hosting the live demo.
flutter_dotenv: For secure API key management.


Future Improvements
Integrate a live conversational model (e.g., microsoft/DialoGPT-small) once API access is stable.
Add message persistence using local storage.
Expand the chatbotâ€™s response capabilities with more dynamic replies.
Implement error handling for API failures in a production environment.


Acknowledgments
Built as part of a portfolio project to demonstrate Flutter skills for a potential employer.
Thanks to Hugging Face for providing free-tier API access (despite limitations).
